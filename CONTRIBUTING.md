## How to submit an idea or suggestion

##### Please note this channel is not designed to formally handle Public Information Requests.
- If you feel your open data suggestion is actually a [request for information](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/open-records) from the City of Austin, your request will need to be handled by our Law Department. While we will do our best to quickly re-route your request to them, it would be faster for you to [submit your request to the Law Department]() directly. Thanks in advance for helping us get this right.

##### Use the GitHub Issues feature [here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-suggestions/issues/new) to send us your message.
- You may need to create a free account with GitHub and sign in.
- If you're not comfortable with that, the City of Austin is also able to accept your message at [this email address](mailto://opendata@austintexas.gov).

## How to contribute as a developer

##### Our current workflow

1. Fork from the `master` branch
2. Please try to keep your fixes and features organized appropriately in commits and branches. Great advice on doing that can be found [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). *Just try your best, no worries =)*
3. Pull requests will be reviewed by content stewards, and upon approval, accepted and merged into `master`
