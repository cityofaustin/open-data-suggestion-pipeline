# Open Data Suggestions <br/>(alpha phase)

***

#### About this project

Austin's open data portal offers a feature for collecting new dataset suggestions from the public, but currently there is no simple way to track the evaluation and outcomes of those suggestions. The City wants to provide timely review of new dataset ideas and share the evaluation status of each in as close to real time as possible.

Some suggestions may be simple to accept or deploy, while others may require legal or committee review. We likely won't capture everything at first, but it's important that we get the documentation started.

### Ongoing improvements

To get a baseline understanding of the City's needs and requirements for a strong Open Dataset Suggestion process, we had a [use case specification](http://austinea.org/arch/pir/requestSuggestedModifiedDataSet/) developed for us by City of Austin Enterprise Architecture. [Check it out!](http://austinea.org/arch/pir/requestSuggestedModifiedDataSet/)

We welcome your feedback for improving the open data suggestion process. Share yours with us [here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-suggestions/issues/new).
