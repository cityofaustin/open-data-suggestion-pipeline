# Open Data Suggestions

This repo is for sharing suggestions about open data with City of Austin staff. It is also a place for City staff to collaborate on the processing of those suggestions. 

Not a frequent GitHub user? Try viewing this project activity on [Waffle.io/cityofaustin](https://waffle.io/cityofaustin/open-data-suggestions). Same stuff, just less "techy" =)

To submit an idea or suggest a new open dataset, please open a new issue [here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-suggestions/issues/new). We'll do our best to get back to you as soon as possible. *(This approach is new for us, so please reach out again if we mistakenly lose touch with you!)*

#### Why we're doing this

Austin's open data portal offers a feature for collecting new dataset suggestions from the public, but currently there is no simple way to track the evaluation and outcomes of those suggestions. The City wants to provide timely review of new suggestions and share the evaluation status of each in as close to real time as possible.

Some suggestions may be simple to accept or deploy, while others may require legal or committee review. We likely won't capture everything at first, but it's important that we get the documentation started.

#### Contributing terms

#### Current project goals

* Explore and document what it means to successfully process an open data suggestion. 
* Start developing a pipeline so staff can collaborate to process suggestions effectively
* Have a plan for identifying public information requests (PIRs) so suggestion reviewers can ensure those requests are re-routed to appropriate City staff.
