#### About this project

Austin's open data portal offers a feature for collecting new dataset suggestions from the public, but currently there is no simple way to track the evaluation and outcomes of those suggestions. There is also no current documentation available that explains which City staff will be responsible for responding to suggestions. The City wants to provide timely review of new dataset ideas and share the evaluation status of each so that it can be tracked throughout the process.

#### Progress to date

To get a baseline understanding of the City's needs and requirements for a strong Open Dataset Suggestion process, we had a [use case specification](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-suggestions/blob/master/use_case_RequestSuggestedModifiedDataset.pdf) developed for us by City of Austin Enterprise Architecture. The document was delivered to the City's data portal vendor in May 2016.

#### Next steps

- Develop or obtain a digital product that delivers the specified requirements
- Write documentation that helps users understand their roles in the Open Data Suggestion process. User roles to be addressed include the open data core team, open data liaisons, and suggestors. 


We welcome your feedback for improving the open data suggestion process. Share yours with us [here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-suggestions/issues/new).
