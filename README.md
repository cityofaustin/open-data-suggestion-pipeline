# Open Data Suggestions (in discovery phase)

A team of City staff members are currently using this repo to build a plan for managing open data suggestions received by the City of Austin. 

This project does not have a definition document. We hope to have one soon. 

## What we're doing right now

Team members are currently working on brainstorming activities that will help set the scope and direction of this project. 
Feel free to browse those activities [here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-suggestions/milestones/discovery%20phase)


#### Why we're doing this

Austin's open data portal offers a feature for collecting new dataset suggestions from the public, but currently there is no simple way to track the evaluation and outcomes of those suggestions. The City wants to provide timely review of new suggestions and share the evaluation status of each in as close to real time as possible.

Some suggestions may be simple to accept or deploy, while others may require legal or committee review. We likely won't capture everything at first, but it's important that we get the documentation started.
