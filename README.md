# Open Data Suggestions



***

#### About this project

Austin's open data portal offers a feature for collecting new dataset suggestions from the public, but currently there is no simple way to track the evaluation and outcomes of those suggestions. The City wants to provide timely review of new dataset ideas and share the evaluation status of each so that it can be tracked throughout the process.

#### Progress to date

To get a baseline understanding of the City's needs and requirements for a strong Open Dataset Suggestion process, we had a [use case specification](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-suggestions/blob/master/use_case_RequestSuggestedModifiedDataset.pdf) developed for us by City of Austin Enterprise Architecture. The document was delivered to the City's data portal vendor in May 2016.

#### Next steps

Now that requirements have been outlined, the next step is to develop or obtain a digital product that delivers the required features. 


We welcome your feedback for improving the open data suggestion process. Share yours with us [here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-suggestions/issues/new).
